# S3 Bucket Management with Python and Boto3

## Overview

This project provides a Python script to manage AWS S3 buckets using the Boto3 library. The script allows you to create, list, and delete S3 buckets, as well as upload, download, and delete files in an S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Boto3**: Install the Boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python:
  ```bash
  pip install boto3
  ```
- **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) should be configured with credentials that have permissions to manage S3 buckets. If you havenâ€™t configured the AWS CLI, follow the [AWS CLI configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

## Features

- **Create S3 Bucket**: Create a new S3 bucket in the specified AWS region.
- **List S3 Buckets**: List all S3 buckets in your AWS account.
- **Delete S3 Bucket**: Delete an existing S3 bucket.
- **Upload File to S3**: Upload a file to a specified S3 bucket.
- **Download File from S3**: Download a file from a specified S3 bucket.
- **Delete File from S3**: Delete a file from a specified S3 bucket.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/s3-bucket-management.git
cd s3-bucket-management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 3. Configure AWS Credentials

Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured. You can do this using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Alternatively, you can use a credentials file or environment variables. Refer to the [Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html) for more details.

### 4. Running the Script

To use the script, simply modify the `example_usage` section with your desired bucket name and file paths, then run the script:

```bash
python s3_bucket_management.py
```

The script will perform the following actions:
1. Create an S3 bucket.
2. List all S3 buckets.
3. Upload a file to the S3 bucket.
4. Download the file from the S3 bucket.
5. Delete the file from the S3 bucket.
6. Delete the S3 bucket.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling to catch and display exceptions that may occur during API calls. If an error occurs, it will be printed to the console with a relevant message.

## Customization

You can extend this project by adding the following features:
- **Bucket Versioning**: Enable versioning on S3 buckets to keep multiple versions of an object.
- **Bucket Encryption**: Enable server-side encryption for buckets to automatically encrypt objects before storing them.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track bucket operations and access.
